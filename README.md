# Fisher Yates (Updated)

Given an array of length A, we want to randomly select N elements while making sure we donâ€™t select the same element twice (random selection without replacement).
Fisher-Yates is an algorithm for shuffling an entire array of length A in O(A) time. Modify the Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm to achieve our goal in O(N) time.

Hint: You should not shuffle the entire array unless N==A.
